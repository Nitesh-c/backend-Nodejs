### ✅ Output:

- Mini projects (form + JS validation)
- GitHub profile setup

---

## 🧭 LEVEL 2: **Backend Development with Node.js**

- JWT Authentication
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- Mongoose / Prisma
- File upload, pagination, search
- Error handling & validation

### ✅ Projects:

- Auth API (JWT, sessions)
- Blog API (CRUD + Auth)
- E-commerce backend (products, cart, orders)

---

## 🧭 LEVEL 3: **Production Readiness**

✅ Time: 1.5 months
🔧 Goal: Prepare code for real-world production

### 📌 Topics:

## 🧭 LEVEL 4: **System-Level Engineering (OS + Network)**

✅ Time: 1 month
🔧 Goal: Think like a real backend *engineer*, not just a coder

### 📌 Topics:

- Reverse Proxy (Nginx basics)

### ✅ Output:

- Documented notes
- Simulated deployment with Nginx + Node.js

---

## 🧭 LEVEL 5: **Advanced CS & Architecture**

✅ Time: 1.5 months
🔧 Goal: Scale systems, prepare for top interviews

### 📌 Topics:

#### 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):

- Arrays, HashMaps, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Graphs
- Recursion
- Sorting, Searching
- Big-O

#### 🏗️ System Design:
